# ml-mxnet
I wanted a step to step evaluation guide to quickly grapes basic concepts of deep learning and have an understanding of the requirements of optimize and scale up the underline infrastructure. I could not find one so I have to start one. 
Here’s my planed topics:
## Topics
* [Simple MXNet](./README.md) - Basic server usage on prebuilt MXNet models.
* [Simple TensorFlow](../ml-tensorflow/README.md) - Basic server usage on prebuilt Tensorflow models.
* [Distributed TensorFlow](../ml-tensorflow-distributed/README.md) – Distributed Tensorflow training and serving
